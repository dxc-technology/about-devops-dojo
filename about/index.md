## What is {{site.title}}?

A collection of DevOps interactive learning modules released under the [Mozilla
Public License
2.0](https://github.com/dxc-technology/online-devops-dojo/blob/master/LICENSE)
and leveraging the [Katacoda](https://katacoda.com){:target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} online learning platform.

We are making the online DevOps Dojo available to the community, in the hope
they will be useful. Our primary goal is not to offer trainings as a service,
but contribute a set of DevOps learning experiences for the community to
assemble and create more content in support of DevOps adoption.

## Contributing

Whether you are interested for yourself, the community or your company, you are
welcome to fork the [Online DevOps
Dojo](https://github.com/dxc-technology/online-devops-dojo) repository - which
contains the source of all the modules - to fix an issue, enhance the learning
scenarios or even add new ones.

You can also fork this repository, the
[About DevOps Dojo](https://github.com/dxc-technology/about-devops-dojo)
repository for use as a home/landing page for your learning scenarios.
