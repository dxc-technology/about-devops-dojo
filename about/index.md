## What is {{site.title}}?

A collection of DevOps interactive learning modules released under the [Mozilla
Public License
2.0](https://github.com/dxc-technology/online-devops-dojo/blob/master/LICENSE)
and leveraging the [Katacoda](https://katacoda.com){:target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} online learning platform.

We are making the online DevOps Dojo available to the community, in the hope
they will be useful. Our primary goal is not to offer trainings as a service,
but contribute a set of DevOps learning experiences for the community to
assemble and create more content in support of DevOps adoption.
