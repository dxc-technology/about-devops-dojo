## What is {{site.title}}?

A collection of DevOps interactive learning modules released under the [Mozilla Public License
2.0](https://github.com/dxc-technology/online-devops-dojo/blob/master/LICENSE) and leveraging the [Katacoda](https://katacoda.com) online learning platform.

We are making the online DevOps Dojo available to the community, in the hope they will be useful. Our primary goal is not to offer
trainings as a service, but contribute a set of DevOps learning experiences for the community to assemble and create more content in
support of DevOps adoption.

## Contributing

Whether you are interested for yourself, the community or your company, you are welcome to fork the [Online DevOps
Dojo](https://github.com/dxc-technology/online-devops-dojo) repository - which contains the source of all the modules - to fix an
issue, enhance the learning scenarios or even add new ones.

You can also fork this repository, the [About DevOps Dojo](https://github.com/dxc-technology/about-devops-dojo) repository for use
as a home/landing page for your learning scenarios.
