## What is Online DevOps Dojo?

The Online DevOps Dojo is a set of hands on training modules which cover both cultural and technical aspects of DevOps.

Technically these modules are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/dxc-technology/online-devops-dojo) and executed on Katakoda platform which make them accessible from your browser without any download or configuration.

DXC Technology has embraced the DevOps transformation for some time internally and for our customers.

We are using multiple homegrown Katacoda scenarios to train our workforces at large scale. Our agenda was inspired by the topics covered by the book [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/) from Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim.
