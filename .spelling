# markdown-spellcheck spelling configuration file
# Format - lines beginning # are comments
# global dictionary is at the start, file overrides afterwards
# one word per line, to define a file override use ' - filename'
# where filename is relative to this configuration file
# ideally put words in alphabetically to avoid dupication
# proper case enforces proper case; lowercase allows both lower and proper case
# use of correct vendor/software product name and capitlization convention helps enforce it
