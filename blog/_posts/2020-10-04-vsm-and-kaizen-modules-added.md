Following the positive community reaction to the launch of the Online DevOps Dojo, we are pleased to announce we have added two more modules to the dojo

* Value Stream Mapping
* DevOps Kaizen

These are in addition to the 5 modules which were included in the initial launch:

* Welcome and Setup
* Leading Change
* Version Control
* Continuous Integration
* Shift Security Left

## VSM and DevOps Kaizen Modules

Value Stream Mapping is a technique we encourage teams to understand the current state and to document the desired state of their process aka their value stream.

Kaizen is a technique used to address the deltas identified between current and desired state VSM's.

## What's next?

The story continues, we will continue to try to give a little bit back to the community we have learnt so much from
