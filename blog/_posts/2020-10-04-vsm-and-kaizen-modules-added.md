Following the positive community reaction to the launch of the Online DevOps Dojo, we are pleased to announce we have added two more modules to the dojo:

* Value Stream Mapping
* DevOps Kaizen

These are in addition to the 5 modules which were included in the initial launch:

* Welcome and Setup
* Leading Change
* Version Control
* Continuous Integration
* Shift Left on Security

## VSM and DevOps Kaizen Modules

Value Stream Mapping is a technique teams use to analyze the current state and design the future state of their software development process.

Kaizen is a technique used to address the deltas identified between current and desired state VSM's.

## What's next?

The story continues, we will continue to try to give a little bit back to the community we have learnt so much from
