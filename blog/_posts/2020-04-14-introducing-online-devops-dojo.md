## DevOps Dojos

DevOps Dojos became popular since Target, an important US based retail company, started to introduce such a practice back in 2014 in support of their DevOps transformation.
Multiple talks at conferences, white papers, and more recently books have been published about DevOps Dojos since then.

Back in 2015, we created our own DevOps Dojos, which we have since then described during multiple talks - [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhokY2UpBqI){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75aZRf0_wSo){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ejcK1sTv6k){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - in conferences and meetups, sharing our own experience.

Since then, our own employees and customers alike have been taking advantage of the DevOps Dojo.

Yet, we quickly came to a point where our physical DevOps Dojos were not enough to cover all the needs. Everyone was loving the
experience, and it still to this day continues to lead to great results. But we had a scale issue: we just could not accommodate everyone we needed to address.

Let us introduce "**Online DevOps Dojos**".

## Extending with Online DevOps Dojo

While continuing physical and face to face DevOps Dojos, we needed to complete the picture with an online add-on. An add-on, not a replacement, that we could use to:

* Prepare for a face-to-face or virtual DevOps Dojo by learning techniques in advance
* Create a complete curriculum with hands on labs
* Provide a way to get knowledge when you most need it, all within your browser
* Share what "good looks like" when answering a question around any DevOps pattern
* Leverage [the story](#a-story), the characters, and even extend the "Pet Clinic multiverse" to create more - not necessarily DevOps related - learning experiences

We could easily have written slides or record videos from our DevOps coaches. But we thought it would have been a sub-par learning experience.

This is how we started on an immersive online learning experience: the "Online DevOps Dojo".

What we recently found out in the light of unprecedented events - such as a world pandemic - is that online learning experiences are now an essential part of a "new normal". A new way of acquiring knowledge and sharing it with others. Social distancing just accelerated that movement.

## A Story

Our challenge was to make the experience immersive. And to immerse youself into something, there is nothing better than a good story. So, we created one to support the learnings.

The modules tell the story of a fictious company with its employees as they go through their DevOps journey.

Let us introduce you to some of the team members:

![Brenda](../../images/brenda.png) | **B**renda from the **B**usiness who is keen to take the Pet Clinic in to new growth areas sees DevOps being key to that. She is extremely proud of her two golden retrievers Bonnie and Clyde.

![Chun](../../images/chun.png) | **C**hun is a **c**oach, change facilitator and technologist. Chun is an avid outdoors person and adrenaline junky, lover of fun, hater of being on-call. She encourages teams to automate as much as possible of the build, test, package and deploy process to ensure that the systems were created with a LessOps model in mind.

![Dan](../../images/dan.png) | **D**an, has worked as a senior developer for a number of years, most recently for First Order Incorporated a role he left due to the excessive travel requirements. Dan's workmates still fondly recall the fun and games which ensued when Shelob, his pet tarantula, got loose on *"Bring Your Pets to Work"* day.

![Adam](../../images/adam.png) | **A**dam is a System **A**dministrator transitioning to the role of Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). Adam is working closely with Selma to ensure the security of the company's software and applications. Adam suspects that Hal may have an inside man. Adam has a particular set of skills so he is working on a plan to look for the hacker, to find the hacker, to ... the hacker.

Throughout the modules, you get to learn everyone (including more characters), sometimes interact with them, and understand how each one of them plays a role in the DevOps transformation of the "Pet Clinic" company.

## Learning modules

The Online DevOps Dojo learning modules illustrate important DevOps patterns, as described in various blog posts, white papers and great books such as "[Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/)" by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim.

At launch, we release 5 modules:

* Welcome and setup
* Leading Change
* Version Control
* Continuous Integration
* Shift Security Left

Those modules are a mix of both cultural and technical topics.

And they all provide a very interactive experience where you can follow the step by step instructions, but also get out of the script to explore and learn more, without fear of breaking anything.

## Open Source

The Online DevOps Dojos learning modules are released under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://github.com/dxc-technology/online-devops-dojo/blob/master/LICENSE).

We are making the online DevOps Dojo available to the community; in the hope they will be useful. Our primary goal is not to offer trainings as a service but contribute a set of DevOps learning experiences for the community to assemble and create more content in support of DevOps adoption.

## What's next?

We first would like to welcome everyone trying out the learning modules. We sincerely hope they will help in supporting your DevOps adoption.

We also plan to release new modules, depending on the reception of the initial launch.

Beyond the initial launch, we are eager to build a community around the Online DevOps Dojo. A community of module maintainers, translators, story tellers and even creators of new learning modules.

Let’s support DevOps adoption!
