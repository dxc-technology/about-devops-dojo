This is in addition to the Welcome and Setup module, and the 6 existing modules on DevOps culture and practices:

* Leading Change
* Version Control
* Continuous Integration
* Shift Left on Security
* Value Stream Mapping
* DevOps Kaizen

## Post Incident Practices Module

Learn how to establish a Safety Culture, conduct blameless post-mortems and create a 'code of conduct' to help your team manage incidents in all phases of their life cycle.
